              Binocular and orthoptic examinations are crucial for assessing the
              coordination and teamwork of your eye muscles. These assessments
              help detect potential binocular vision disorders, which may cause
              symptoms such as eye strain, headaches, tired eyes, intermittent
              blurry vision, difficulty maintaining focus, or even sleepiness
              after prolonged visual tasks.

                  Additionally, stereopsis assessment—the ability to perceive
                  depth and 3D vision—is an integral part of a comprehensive
                  binocular vision evaluation. Impaired stereopsis can affect
                  tasks like reading, sports performance, or any activity
                  requiring precise hand-eye coordination.

                  At Trinity Optics, we conduct detailed binocular vision
                  assessments to diagnose accommodation and vergence disorders.
                  These conditions, once identified, are treated using a
                  combination of in-office vision therapy and tailored home
                  vision therapy exercises. Our clinic also offers specialized
                  tools to enhance stereopsis, helping patients achieve optimal
