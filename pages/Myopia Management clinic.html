            >MiyoSmart – A World First Our myopia management expert Optometrist
            Samuel Livingstone K commented: “MiyoSmart is a very exciting
            addition to our ever-growing toolkit for slowing the progression of
            myopia in children. MiyoSmart is the first spectacle lens product
            approved for the treatment of myopia. The levels of myopia
            progression reduction reported in the MiyoSmart 2-year clinical
            trial data are similar to those found with other methods we use in
            practice such as MiSight contact lenses.</span
          >
          <span
            >MiyoSmart allows us to start myopia management strategy right away
            in these children and we can slowly introduce the idea of contact
            lens wear later. MiyoSmart also offers us the opportunity for
            families to use both spectacles and contact lenses options in
            conjunction with one another to allow the child to choose when
            contact lenses or spectacles are more suitable to their task without
            having to compromise myopia progression.</span

        <span
          >Children are spending more time indoors and on screens doing
          schoolwork after COVID-19. The result of this increase in time spent
          indoors and the increased use of computers, tablets, and smartphones
          for both schoolwork and leisure is that we are seeing an acceleration
          of myopia in many children. If we can achieve 100% of a child’s day
          with a myopia management corrective lens whether contact lens or
          spectacle lens in the form of MiyoSmart, we can reduce the likelihood
          that the child’s myopia will worsen during lockdown.”</span

          >Essilor Stellest Essilor Stellest lenses are designed to slow down
          myopia progression in children by creating simultaneous competing
          defocus. They offer good vision, comfort, and UV protection for all
          viewing angles. Essilor Stellest lenses slow down myopia progression
          by 67% on average, compared to single vision lenses, when worn 12
          hours a day.</span

        <span
          >Zeiss MyoCare Zeiss MyoCare lenses incorporate cylindrical annular
          refractive elements (C.A.R.E.) to slow the elongation of the eyeball
          while delivering good, comfortable vision. They are designed to slow
          down myopia progression by creating simultaneous competing defocus at
          the retina.</span
